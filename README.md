Hyperledger Burrow is a permissioned Ethereum smart-contract blockchain node built with <3 by Monax. It executes Ethereum smart contract code on a permissioned virtual machine. Burrow provides transaction finality and high transaction throughput on a proof-of-stake Tendermint consensus engine. For smart contract development most functionality is provided by `monax chains`, exposed through [monax](https://monax.io/docs/), the entry point for the Monax Platform.

## What is Burrow ?

Hyperledger Burrow is a permissioned blockchain node that executes smart contract code following the Ethereum specification.  Burrow is built for a multi-chain universe with application specific optimization in mind. Burrow as a node is constructed out of three main components; the consensus engine, the permissioned Ethereum virtual machine and the rpc gateway.  More specifically Burrow consists of the following:

- **Consensus Engine:** transactions are ordered and finalised with the Byzantine fault-tolerant Tendermint protocol.  The Tendermint protocol provides high transaction throughput over a set of known validators and prevents the blockchain from forking.
- **Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI):** The smart contract application interfaces with the consensus engine over the ABCI. The ABCI allows for the consensus engine to remain agnostic from the smart contract application.
- **Smart Contract Application:** transactions are validated and applied to the application state in the order that the consensus engine has finalised them.  The application state consists of all accounts, the validator set and the name registry. Accounts in Burrow have permissions and either contain smart contract code or correspond to a public-private key pair. A transaction that calls on the smart contract code in a given account will activate the execution of that account’s code in a permissioned virtual machine.
- **Permissioned Ethereum Virtual Machine:** This virtual machine is built to observe the Ethereum operation code specification and additionally asserts the correct permissions have been granted. Permissioning is enforced through secure native functions and underlies all smart contract code. An arbitrary but finite amount of gas is handed out for every execution to ensure a finite execution duration - “You don’t need money to play, when you have permission to play”.
- **Application Binary Interface (ABI):** transactions need to be formulated in a binary format that can be processed by the blockchain node.  Currently tooling provides functionality to compile, deploy and link solidity smart contracts and formulate transactions to call smart contracts on the chain.  For proof-of-concept purposes we provide a monax-contracts.js library that automatically mirrors the smart contracts deployed on the chain and to develop middleware solutions against the blockchain network.  Future work on the light client will be aware of the ABI to natively translate calls on the API into signed transactions that can be broadcast on the network.
- **API Gateway:** Burrow exposes REST and JSON-RPC endpoints to interact with the blockchain network and the application state through broadcasting transactions, or querying the current state of the application. Websockets allow to subscribe to events, which is particularly valuable as the consensus engine and smart contract application can give unambiguously finalised results to transactions within one blocktime of about one second.

Burrow has been architected with a longer term vision on security and data privacy from the outset:

- **Cryptographically Secured Consensus:** proof-of-stake Tendermint protocol achieves consensus over a known set of validators where every block is closed with cryptographic signatures from a majority of validators only.  No unknown variables come into play while reaching consensus on the network (as is the case for proof-of-work consensus). This guarantees that all actions on the network are fully cryptographically verified and traceable.
- **Remote Signing:** transactions can be signed by elliptic curve cryptographic algorithms, either ed25519/sha512 or secp256k1/sha256 are currently supported. Burrow connects to a remote signing solution to generate key pairs and request signatures. Monax-keys is a placeholder for a reverse proxy into your secure signing solution. This has always been the case for transaction formulation and work continues to enable remote signing for the validator block signatures too.
- **Secure Signing:** Monax is a legal engineering company; we partner with expert companies to natively support secure signing solutions going forward.
- **Multi-chain Universe (Step 1 of 3):** from the start the monax platform has been conceived for orchestrating many chains, as exemplified by the command “monax chains make” or by that transactions are only valid on the intended chain. Separating state into different chains is only the first of three steps towards privacy on smart contract chains (see future work below).

## Installation

`burrow` is intended to be used by the `monax chains` command via [monax](https://monax.io/docs). Available commands such as `make | start | stop | logs | inspect | update` are used for chain lifecycle management.

### For Developers
Dependency management for Burrow is managed with [glide](github.com/Masterminds/glide), and you can build Burrow from source by following

- [Install go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- Ensure you have `gmp` installed (`sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev || brew install gmp`)
- and execute following commands in a terminal:
- `go get github.com/Masterminds/glide`
- `go get -d github.com/hyperledger/burrow`
- `REPO=$($GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/burrow)`
- `cd $REPO && glide install`
- `cd $REPO/cmd/burrow && go install`


To run `burrow`, just type `$ burrow serve --work-dir <path to chain directory>`, where the chain directory needs to contain the configuration, genesis file, and private validator file as generated by `monax chains make`.

This will start the node using the provided folder as working dir. If the path is omitted it defaults to `~/.monax`.

For a Vagrant file see [monax-vagrant](https://github.com/monax/monax-vagrant) for drafts or soon this repo for [Vagrant](https://github.com/hyperledger/burrow/issues/514) and Packer files.

## Usage

Once the server has started, it will begin syncing up with the network. At that point you may begin using it. The preferred way is through our [javascript api](https://github.com/monax/legacy-contracts.js), but it is possible to connect directly via HTTP or websocket.

## Configuration

A commented template config will be written as part of the `monax chains make` [process](https://monax.io/docs/getting-started) and can be edited prior to the `monax chains start` [process](https://monax.io/docs/getting-started).

### Logging
Logging is highly configurable through the `config.toml` `[logging]` section. Each log line is a list of key-value pairs that flows from the root sink through possible child sinks. Each sink can have an output, a transform, and sinks that it outputs to. Below is a more involved example of than the one appearing in the default generated config of what you can configure: 

```toml
# This is a top level config section within the main Burrow config
[logging]
  # All log lines are sent to the root sink from all sources
  [logging.root_sink]
    # We define two child sinks that each receive all log lines
    [[logging.root_sink.sinks]]
      # We send all output to stderr
      [logging.root_sink.sinks.output]
        output_type = "stderr"

    [[logging.root_sink.sinks]]
      # But for the second sink we define a transform that filters log lines from Tendermint's p2p module
      [logging.root_sink.sinks.transform]
        transform_type = "filter"
        filter_mode = "exclude_when_all_match"

        [[logging.root_sink.sinks.transform.predicates]]
          key_regex = "module"
          value_regex = "p2p"

        [[logging.root_sink.sinks.transform.predicates]]
          key_regex = "captured_logging_source"
          value_regex = "tendermint_log15"

      # The child sinks of this filter transform sink are syslog and file and will omit log lines originating from p2p
      [[logging.root_sink.sinks.sinks]]
        [logging.root_sink.sinks.sinks.output]
          output_type = "syslog"
          url = ""
          tag = "Burrow-network"

      [[logging.root_sink.sinks.sinks]]
        [logging.root_sink.sinks.sinks.output]
          output_type = "file"
          path = "/var/log/burrow-network.log"
```
